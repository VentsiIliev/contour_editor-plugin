"""
Workpiece Editor Package

Adds workpiece-specific functionality on top of the domain-agnostic contour_editor.
This package handles workpiece data models, transformation adapters, and
workpiece-aware handlers.

Public API for workpiece-specific applications:
- WorkpieceEditorBuilder: Builder that wraps ContourEditorBuilder with workpiece support
- WorkpieceAdapter: Convert between workpiece objects and ContourEditorData
- WorkpieceManager: Manage workpiece loading/exporting
- Handlers: SaveWorkpieceHandler, CaptureDataHandler, load_workpiece
- Models: BaseWorkpiece, GenericWorkpiece, WorkpieceFactory, WorkpieceField
